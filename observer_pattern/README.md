# Observer Pattern

## ðŸ”¹ What is the Observer Pattern?

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (Subject/Publisher) maintains a list of dependents (Observers/Subscribers) and automatically notifies them of any state changes.

- Provides methods to attach/detach observers.
- Notifies observers when a change happens.

### **Observer (Subscriber)**
- Defines an interface to receive updates from the subject.

### **ConcreteSubject**
- Implements Subject and maintains state.
- Notifies observers when state changes.

### **ConcreteObserver**
- Implements Observer and updates itself based on Subject changes.
